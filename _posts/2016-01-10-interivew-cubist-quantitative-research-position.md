## Phone Interview (with director)

1. Introduce yourself, PhD research.

2. Can you apply your PhD research into financial time series? (After the phone call, I guess this is the only question I answered it wrong. I said No and I explained. But I am not sure if he asked about my general ML knowledge or my PhD thesis.)

3. Explain the intuitions and optimizations of Lasso, ridge, and group Lasso.
