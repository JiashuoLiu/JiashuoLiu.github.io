## Phone Interview

1. Have a fair coin and you can flip it many times. Now you are asked to make a Yes-or-No decision based on probabilities: 1/3 chance say "Yes" and 2/3 chance say "No". How do you flip the coin to make the decision?

2. You have two sampels of data points. How do you tell if they come from the same distribution or not.

3. You have a candy machine which only produces blue candy and red candy. You observed that the machine produces 10 candies: 6 blue and 4 red. Now an operator says "The machine is more likely to produce blue candy than red candy." Is he true? How do you make your inference about the candy machine?

4. You are given a black box which accepts any input $$x$$ and outputs $$p(X \leq x)$$. How do you test the black box? How do you know the distribution of $$X$$?
