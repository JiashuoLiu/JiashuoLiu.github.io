## 1st Phone Interview

1. Briefly introduce your PhD work and some internship experience. 

2. Difference between hidden Markov models and linear dynamical system.

3. Coding questions: similar to the Leetcode question: [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) but in an image processing setting. Only 15 minutes are given and I guess they expect a quick mind and bug-free code.
