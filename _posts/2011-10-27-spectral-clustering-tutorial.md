I created a slides for very basic introduction to spectral clustering. Here it is: [http://www.slideshare.net/hnly228078/spectral-clustering-tutorial](http://www.slideshare.net/hnly228078/spectral-clustering-tutorial).

All the content in my slides are based on [Von Luxburg, Ulrike. "A tutorial on spectral clustering." Statistics and computing 17.4 (2007): 395-416.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.0189.pdf).

The agenda of this tutorial as follows:

* Brief Clustering Review
* Similarity Graph
* Graph Laplacian
* Spectral Clustering Algorithm
* Graph Cut Point of View
* Random Walk Point of View
* Perturbation Theory Point of View
* Practical Details
