Yesterday, our department [homepage](http://www.cs.pitt.edu/) officially announced that my advisor [Milos Hauskrecht](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos) is promoted to be a full professor. Our group decides to buy a chocolate cake to celebrate it. [Eric](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~eth13/) bought a big cake from Costco. 

It has been a long time since we took the group picture last time and thanks to [Salim](http://salimm.me/)! We got the new group photo! Two new members join our lab this year. Hope we can have some collaboration in the future.
