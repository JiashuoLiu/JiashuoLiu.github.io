I created a slides for very basic introduction to Probabilistic Models of Time Series and Sequences. Here it is: [http://www.slideshare.net/hnly228078/hmmlds](http://www.slideshare.net/hnly228078/hmmlds).

The agenda of this tutorial as follows:

* Introduction
* Markov Models
* Hidden Markov Models
	* Inference
	* Learning
* Linear Dynamical Systems
	* Inference
	* Learning
* Recent Work
