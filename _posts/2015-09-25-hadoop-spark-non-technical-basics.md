We have an intensive group meeting today to **briefly** discuss some hot topics in the big data analytics. 

The  topics are:

* Distributed databases ([Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/)) -- Salim
* Distributed analytics (with [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)) -- Zitao
* Programming languages and data analytics libraries focus on [R](https://www.r-project.org/)  -- Siqi
* ML/Data mining environments: [WEKA](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/), [KNIME](https://www.knime.org/) -- Yanbing
* Data visualization libraries/tools --  Charmgil

Since none of us is the expert in domains such as big data/high performance computing/distributed system, the discussion is joyful and pleasant :) 

I have used Hadoop for two internships and am kinda familiar with how to use it and a little bit about its mechanism. I read some blogs/posts/slides/papers about Spark, which is a buzz word nowadays in industry. 

I have made a slides which gives a non-technical introduction about Hadoop and Spark.
