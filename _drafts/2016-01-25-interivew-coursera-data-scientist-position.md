## Phone Interview

1. A coding question: You are given a string containing a comma-separated list of tokens. Tokens may have zero length, contain internal commas, or be surrounded by double quotes ("). Write a function that parses the string character-by-character and returns a list of tokens, preserving any quoted tokens.

Just pay attention to the corner cases. Many corner cases.


2. Given a real click through rate setting (numbers are given), how to estimate standar errors, expectations, confidence intervals, and how to do hypothesis testing. 

3. A product manager has asked you what the likely impact of reducing the length of a course (in weeks) will be on the conversion rate (i.e., the proportion of course participants who pay for the certificate program). What sort of insights can you provide using historical data?

4. How to interpret linear regression results? $$ y = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2 $$.
