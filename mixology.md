## Mixology

### When I am not doing research and building things, I like to make cocktails. A. Lot.

After two years self exploration, it's time to get professional guidance as well as bells and whistles. Still on my way to mixology but milestone achieved: got my certificate after four full days training and the exam from [ABC Bartending School](http://www.abcbartending.com/index.php) in Seattle, WA!

### Kamikazee

Kamikazee, one of my fav drink. It also has a Chinses name "神风特攻队", which are suicide attacks by Japanese military aviators in World War II. What a tragic life! Vodka, Triple Sec and lime juice. I add fresh muddled lime to make it as a J's speciality.

### Lemon Drop

Lemon drop (坠落的柠檬). Arguably one of the girl fav drinks. Most people (Chinese) heard of "lemon drop" is due to the mania of HarryPotter. It's easy to make it and it tastes perfect: sweet & sour. I like to add muddled lemon to make it fresh. Ingredients: Vodka, Triple sec and sour.

### SPA Cosmo Martini

SPA cosmo martini. Had this drink with Shumo on my Bday. It was fantastic. Today I made it. Such a pleasant smell with muddled cucumber inside. Furthermore, it is naturally layered! Feel accomplished! SPA COSMO MARTINI = Vodka + Fresh muddled cucumber + Cranberry juice + Fresh squeezed lime!
