> When I am not doing research and building things, I like to make cocktails. A. Lot.

After two years (since 2013) self exploration, it's time to get professional guidance as well as bells and whistles. Still on my way to mixology but milestone achieved: got my certificate after four full days training and the exam from [ABC Bartending School](http://www.abcbartending.com/index.php) in Seattle, WA!

#### Some drinks I enjoyed.

From top to bottom, left to right

* **Tom Collins**. Identified as "a favorite drink in demand everywhere", the Tom Collins is a Collins cocktail made from gin, lemon juice, sugar and carbonated water. First memorialized in writing in 1876 by "the father of American mixology" Jerry Thomas.

* **Viva Villa**. A sweet and sour cocktail made with tequila, lemon juice, lime juice and simple syrup. Sweet & Sour, a terrific company with dark night reading.

* **Kamikazee**. One of my fav drink. It also has a Chinese name "神风特攻队", which are suicide attacks by Japanese military aviators in World War II. What a tragic life! Vodka, Triple Sec and lime juice. I add fresh muddled lime to make it as a J's specialty.

* **Caipirissima**. A rock glass filled with a whole lime! It has an intriguing rustic edginess. To make it? Very simple: Vodka + Simple Syrup + Muddled lime + Lime wedge. And of course, ICE.

* **Cosmopolitan**. Often refers as to "Cosmo", is arguably one of the widely drink appeared in the movie which is made with vodka, triple sec, cranberry juice, and freshly squeezed or sweetened lime juice. In Chinese, we call it "大都会". The Cosmopolitan gained popularity in the 1990s. Furthermore, it got popularized among young women by its frequent mention on the television program "Sex and the City". 

* **Lemon Drop(坠落的柠檬)**. Arguably one of the girl fav drinks. Most people (Chinese) heard of "lemon drop" is due to the mania of HarryPotter. It's easy to make it and it tastes perfect: sweet & sour. I like to add muddled lemon to make it fresh. Ingredients: Vodka, Triple sec and sour. 

* **Grinch**. This little adorable drink got its name from the famous movie "The Grinch" (圣诞怪杰) in 2000. A fantastic sweeten drink with NO spirits inside. Completely out of my expectation! The melon flavor Midori, lemon juice, and simple syrup just make it perfect for fun. 

* **SPA Cosmo Martini**. Had this drink with Shumo on my Bday. It was fantastic. Today I made it. Such a pleasant smell with muddled cucumber inside. Furthermore, it is naturally layered! Feel accomplished! SPA COSMO MARTINI = Vodka + Fresh muddled cucumber + Cranberry juice + Fresh squeezed lime!
