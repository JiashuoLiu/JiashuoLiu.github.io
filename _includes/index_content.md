I work at TAL Education Group since 2018. I lead a team working on ML/CV/NLP/Speech problems and its applications in K-12 education.

Prior to joining TAL, I was a senior applied scientist at Pinterest. I obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science at University of Pittsburgh. His Ph.D. advisor is Professor [Milos Hauskrecht](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/). 

I was also fortunate to work as a research intern at Alibaba iDST (2015), Yahoo! Labs (2014), eBay Research Lab (2013), and a software engineer intern at Google (2012).
