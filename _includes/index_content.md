I work as an applied scientist at [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com) since 2016.  

Prior to joining Pinterest, I obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science at University of Pittsburgh, where I was a research assistant under Professor [Milos Hauskrecht](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/). My research work focuses on clinical time series modeling. 

I was also fortunate to work as a research intern at Alibaba iDST (2015), Yahoo! Labs (2014), eBay Research Lab (2013), and a software engineer intern at Google (2012).
