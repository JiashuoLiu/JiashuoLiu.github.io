### Jerry Zitao Liu 刘子韬

I work as an applied scientist at [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com) since 2016.  

Prior to joining Pinterest, I obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science at University of Pittsburgh, where I was a research assistant under Professor [Milos Hauskrecht](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/). My research work focuses on clinical time series modeling. 

I was also fortunate to work as a research intern at [Alibaba Group](http://data.alibaba.com/)(2015), [Yahoo! Labs](http://labs.yahoo.com/)(2014), [eBay Research Lab](http://labs.ebay.com/)(2013), and a software engineer intern at [Google](http://www.google.com/)(2012).
