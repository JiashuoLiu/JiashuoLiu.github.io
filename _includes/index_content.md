I work in applied science team at [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com). 

Prior to joining Pinterest in August 2016, I obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science at University of Pittsburgh, where I was a research assistant under Professor [Milos Hauskrecht](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/). My research work focuses on clinical data modeling, especially in time series domain. My research work was funded mostly by National Institutes of Health (NIH). I was awarded the Andrew Mellon Predoctoral Fellowship for the school year 2015-2016.

I was also fortunate to work as a research intern at [Alibaba Group](http://data.alibaba.com/)(2015), [Yahoo! Labs](http://labs.yahoo.com/)(2014), [eBay Research Lab](http://labs.ebay.com/)(2013), and a software engineer intern at [Google](http://www.google.com/)(2012).
