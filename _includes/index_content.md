## Jerry Zitao Liu 刘子韬

I am a Ph.D. Candidate working with Professor [Milos Hauskrecht](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/) in Department of Computer Science at University of Pittsburgh. My research work focuses on clinical data modeling, especially in time series domain. My research work was funded mostly by National Institutes of Health (NIH). I was awarded the Andrew Mellon Predoctoral Fellowship for the school year 2015-2016.

<!--I thrill to develop machine learning and data mining algorithmic solutions with theoretical guarantees to real-world problems from noisy, large-scale, heterogeneous and sparse data. -->

I received my Bachelor from [Wuhan University](http://en.whu.edu.cn/) in China. During my past 5 years of Ph.D. life, I worked as a research intern at [Alibaba Group](http://data.alibaba.com/)(2015), [Yahoo! Labs](http://labs.yahoo.com/)(2014), [eBay Research Lab](http://labs.ebay.com/)(2013), and was a software engineer intern at [Google](http://www.google.com/)(2012).
